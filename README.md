# Machine-Learning-Experiment
This is the code for the experiment I did in the machine learning course, without pytorch and tensorflow.

I used train_test_split from sklearn.model_selection to split the data set, and load_svmlight_file from sklearn.datasets to load the data.

The matplotlib is necessary for visulization.
